# CheckMyTicket

With blockchain technologies, we expect to create a more open, transparent and fair platform for all users and artist. By giving them the opportunity to create more utility to their tickets before, during and after an event. And producing an everlasting nft that can be used in creative ways such as VIP access, meet and greets, offers, digital collectibles, access tokens, etc. And  empowering artist with royalties obtained from every trade made inside the platform. Although the resell can not be stop completely with our marketplace we offer a safeplace for nfts owner to trade their tickets/nfts.

# Problems

## Problem #1

Resell is a big problem because normal platforms don't have a way of reselling inside the platform. 

### Solution

The platform uses blockchain to allow users to transfer nfts to another wallets. Also allows people to make offers to the nfts and the current owner to sell. 

## Problem #2

Artists don't get royalties for the resells. 

### Solution

By allowing the tickets to resell inside the platform, the artists can get a percentage of the sell as a royalty. 

## Problem #3

Customers forgets about the concert/event right after it finishes. 

### Solution

The artists can create experiences after the event only to holders of the vip nfts. Making those nfts even more valuable and encouraging people to buy after the event.
