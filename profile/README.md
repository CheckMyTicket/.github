# CheckMyTicket

With blockchain technologies, we expect to create a more open, transparent and fair platform for all users and artist. By giving them the opportunity to create more utility to their tickets before, during and after an event. And producing an everlasting nft that can be used in creative ways such as VIP access, meet and greets, offers, digital collectibles, access tokens, etc. And  empowering artist with royalties obtained from every trade made inside the platform. And with our marketplace we will offer a safe place for nfts owner to trade their tickets/nfts.
