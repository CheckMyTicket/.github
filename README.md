# CheckMyTicket

CheckMyTicket is a platform that uses blockchain technology to sell event tickets, addressing problems such as ticket reselling and artist royalties. The platform creates a relationship between customers and artists, allowing customers to buy NFTs that represent tickets and giving them access to exclusive artist communities and merchandise. 

# Problems

## Problem #1

Resell is a big problem because normal platforms don't have a way of reselling inside the platform. 

### Solution

The platform uses blockchain to allow users to transfer nfts to another wallets. Also allows people to make offers to the nfts and the current owner to sell. 

## Problem #2

Artists don't get royalties for the resells. 

### Solution

By allowing the tickets to resell inside the platform, the artists can get a percentage of the sell as a royalty. 

## Problem #3

Customers forgets about the concert/event right after it finishes. 

### Solution

The artists can create experiences after the event only to holders of the vip nfts. Making those nfts even more valuable and encouraging people to buy after the event.
